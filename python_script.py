# # Introduction

# A consultant's firm client wants to mitigate its costs on AWS platform and, so, we are in charge of finding a solution for this issue based on 2 solutions:
# 1.	Forecasting Cloud Spend for the Next Quarter: The client wants to develop a forecast for their cloud spend to build their budget for the upcoming quarter. This involves using the cost and billing usage report from the past 18 months to predict the expected cloud spend for the next quarter accurately.
# 2.	Identifying Spend Areas for Optimization Efforts: The client wants to understand which specific AWS services are driving growth in their spend so that they can prioritize optimization efforts. He also wants to know if the efforts on Product and/or on Service should be prioritized and which ones.
# 
# We'll decompose the answer of the 2 problems into 4 parts:
# 
# 
# 
# *   Data Exploration and Analysis
# *   Feature Engineering
# *   Forecasting models using ML and DL to answer question 1
# *   Cluster Analysis to answer question 2
#

# So far, we can see that this dataset is relatively large with low dimensionality in terms of columns. We have a date column ('usage_date'), which will be key to perform the time series forecasting, 2 measure float continuous variables ('usage_amount' and 'amortized_cost') and 8 remaining categorical variables (some related with AWS service and the others related clientâ€™s infrastructure components).
# **The variable 'amortized_cost' which is what we want to predict in the forecast - dependent variable of our models.**

# We see some coluns with null values as well and we have to decide later what to do with those missing values. Some categorical values have a lot of cardinality as well (or distinct values), which is not a good indicator for creating any model. However, there are some dominant values and there can be a lot of insignificant categories in each variable.
# As far as the continuous variables we can see, is that there are negative values, which don't make sense and will be removed (unless is some kind of correction) and the percentile 25 is 0 in both cases, indicating, right away, **that we have a lot of free costs usage and a lot of operations with an insignicficant amount of usage**.

# Below, let's try to find relationships between variables and do exploratory analysis on what can be cleaned as well or redo, in order to reduce some volumetry for the database (which will easy the modelling part) as well to do some treatments on the categorical fields - feature engineering.

# ###Variable Analysis / Feature Engineering

# #### Date Variable - *Usage Date*

# This is the date variable that is key to model the forecasting with a certain lag the future 6 months of costs. This is has a daily distribution and goes from 2021-10-01 to 2023-03-31.

# In[14]:


# let's check if we have all days

date_gb = df_raw.groupby('usage_date', dropna=False).agg({'amortized_cost':'count'}).reset_index()

date_gb['date_gap'] = date_gb['usage_date'].diff()
date_gb


# In[15]:


date_gb.date_gap.value_counts()


# Indeed we have all consecutive days from first to last date!

# It might be relevant to include variables like the weekday, the month, or even the quarter, to see if there is some **seasonality** in terms of higher or lower costs. For the year, it doesnt make sense to check because we have less months for 2021 and 2023 compared to the full 2022.

# In[16]:


df_initial = df_raw.copy()
df_initial['month'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(df_initial['usage_date']).month
df_initial['quarter'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(df_initial['usage_date']).quarter
df_initial['weekday'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(df_initial['usage_date']).weekday # 0 monday to 6 sunday
df_initial


# **Let's check now the distribution of days with the dependent variable, the amortized cost.**

# In[19]:


# plot the relationship between both variables
def scatterplot(df, x, y, title, figsize = (10,10), ylim = (0,None)):
  plt.figure(figsize=figsize)
  plt.scatter(df[x], df[y])
  plt.xlabel(x)
  plt.ylabel(y)
  plt.ylim(ylim)
  plt.title(title)

  return plt.show()

scatterplot(df_initial, 'usage_date', 'amortized_cost', "Cost per Day")


# In[20]:


# now zoomed in

scatterplot(df_initial, 'usage_date', 'amortized_cost', "Cost per Day", ylim = (0,100))


# Right now, its difficult to reach any conclusion, as expected, because we have many data points. What we can see already are outliers.
# **Let's check the same but for the other new date columns (filtering for 2022 only so that we avoid bias with incomplete 2021 and 2023 years).**

# In[21]:


#zoomed in as well from now on to capture the least amount of outliers

df_2022 = df_initial[pd.DatetimeIndex(df_initial['usage_date']).year == 2022]


scatterplot(df_2022, 'month', 'amortized_cost', "Cost per Month", ylim = (0,100))


# In[22]:


scatterplot(df_2022, 'quarter', 'amortized_cost', "Cost per Quarter", ylim = (0,100))


# In[23]:


scatterplot(df_2022, 'weekday', 'amortized_cost', "Cost per Weekday", ylim = (0,100))


# So, with all these graphs, it's noticeable that:
# 
# 
# *   There seems to have more concentration of costs in the beggining of the year than in the middle of the year (Q1 vs Q3).
# *   As expected, July and August seem to be the months where there are less costs (due to reduced working load between working people and resources usage, as its presumable).
# *   Regarding the week day, it seems more or less uniform between them.
# 
# 
# 
# 

# #### Dependent Variable - Amortized Cost

# This is the variable we want to predict based on several other independent variables, like the Product Tag and many others, as we will see.

# In[24]:


sns.boxplot(
    data=df_initial, x="amortized_cost",
    notch=True, showcaps=False,
    flierprops={"marker": "x"},
    boxprops={"facecolor": (.4, .6, .8, .5)},
    medianprops={"color": "coral"},
)


# The median is very close to 0 as seen here in the boxplot above (we can't even see a box given the huge dispersion of outliers).
# So, now, let's remove some outliers based on the 99 percentile.

# In[25]:


df2 = df_initial[df_initial.amortized_cost < df_initial.amortized_cost.quantile(.99)]

summary(df2)


# Even though we removed only 17377 rows, we see that the maximum value now for the dependent variable (trimmed to the 99% observation) is only about 34, which is a very different level of magnitude compared to other values.

# #### *Usage Amount*

# This can be potentially one of the many independent variables and it's the only other float continuous type. It's interesting to check for outliers in this variables as well and **the relationship it has with the amortized_cost.**

# In[26]:


sns.boxplot(
    data=df_initial, x="usage_amount",
    notch=True, showcaps=False,
    flierprops={"marker": "x"},
    boxprops={"facecolor": (.4, .6, .8, .5)},
    medianprops={"color": "coral"},
)


# The same kind of conclusions apply here, where we have some extreme values that bias the distribution of values visually, so, **let's remove the 1% higher percentile as well.**

# In[27]:


df3 = df2[df2.usage_amount < df2.usage_amount.quantile(.99)]
summary(df3)


# Still, we see that maximum values can be considered outliers when compared to the 75 percentile (same applies to the cost variable), however, let's keep them because they can be useful for the models.

# Now, it's time to remove some more rows based on the lack of coeherency between these 2 variables. In my opinion, **having negative costs or usage amount don't make any sense, and, observations with 0 usage and 0 costs are not relevant for our objective, so, they will be deleted.**

# In[28]:


df4 = df3[~((df3['amortized_cost'] <= 0) & (df3['usage_amount'] <= 0) | (df3['amortized_cost'] < 0) | (df3['usage_amount'] < 0))]
summary(df4)


# In[29]:


# relationship of usage with cost, values filtered to be closer to the median (on the usage), so that we can try to extrapolate something

mpl.rcParams['agg.path.chunksize'] = 10000

plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
plt.scatter(df4['usage_amount'], df4['amortized_cost'])
plt.xlabel('usage_amount')
plt.ylabel('amortized_cost')
plt.ylim((0, 1))
plt.xlim((0, 0.30))
plt.title('Cost per usage')

plt.show()


# By analysing the above graph, we conclude it's not easy to find a direct relationship between these 2 variables. On one hand, we see one line that indicates a positive correlation between them (whenever the usage goes up, the costs as well), but we see a lot of free usage as well, where we use free products, most likely, or, on the other hand, we have can have little usage and spend a lot (more expensive products).

# #### *Line Item type*

# This variable indicates us what type of service are we using. It's pretty simple with only 4 distinct classes and let's see if it's useful for discovering relations with the dependent variable.

# In[30]:


plt.figure(figsize=(15,8))
splot = sns.countplot(x="line_item_type",data=df4)
for p in splot.patches:
  splot.annotate(format(p.get_height(), '.2f'), (p.get_x() + p.get_width() / 2., p.get_height()),  ha = 'center', va = 'center', xytext = (0, 5), textcoords = 'offset points')


# In[31]:


plt.figure(figsize=(15,8))
splot = sns.barplot(data=df4, x="line_item_type", y="amortized_cost")
for p in splot.patches:
  splot.annotate(format(p.get_height(), '.2f'), (p.get_x() + p.get_width() / 2., p.get_height()),  ha = 'center', va = 'center', xytext = (0, 10), textcoords = 'offset points')


# As we see, there is a huge dominance in "Usage" kind of line item with more than 98% of totalcount of rows. As far as cost is concerned, we see actually being the category with the least average of it (probably most of them happen when we have free costs (=0)). **This means, that it can be useful to still consider this variable instead of just ignoring it. However, we will merge all other 3 values into one - "other"**. Still, later, it's useful to discover if this new category has some meaning whatsoever.

# In[32]:


df5 = df4.copy()
df5['line_item_type'] = np.where(df5['line_item_type'] != 'Usage', 'Other', df5['line_item_type'])
df5.groupby('line_item_type', dropna=False).agg({'amortized_cost':'count', 'usage_amount':'sum'}).reset_index()


# #### *Product Code*

# This variable indicates us what AWS service/product was used on each daily operation. It contains 58 distinct values right now, so let's assess its relevance and distribution.

# In[33]:


product_grouped = df5.groupby('product_code', dropna=False).agg({'amortized_cost':['count', 'sum']}).reset_index()#.sort_values('amortized_cost', ascending=False)
product_grouped.columns = product_grouped.columns.map('_'.join)
product_grouped['pct_count'] = round(product_grouped['amortized_cost_count'] * 100/sum(product_grouped['amortized_cost_count']), 1)
product_grouped['pct_cost'] = round(product_grouped['amortized_cost_sum'] * 100/sum(product_grouped['amortized_cost_sum']), 1)#.sort_values('pct_cost', ascending=False)
product_grouped = product_grouped.sort_values('pct_cost', ascending=False)
product_grouped


# In[34]:


# what if we choose just the values which appear either more than 1% of total rows or total costs?
pg_new = product_grouped[(product_grouped['pct_count'] > 1) | (product_grouped['pct_cost'] > 1)]
pg_new


# As we can see, the dominance in this field is not so high as the previous one. However, there are a lot of irrelevant values whether because they are not representative in the whole column or they don't have many costs associated.
# What we will do, in this case, is to take the first 20 values (representing more than 1% of either costs or count) and the remaining we put as "other").

# In[35]:


df6 = df5.copy()
df6['product_code'] = np.where(df6['product_code'].isin(list(pg_new['product_code_'])), df6['product_code'], 'Other')
df6.groupby('product_code', dropna=False).agg({'amortized_cost':'count', 'usage_amount':'sum'}).reset_index()


# #### *Line Item Description*

# This variable contains 2 kinds of info in the same string:
# - the cost per something (some unit usage)
# - the place where it was (an instance, a country, etc).
# 
# As we are going to see now, this information can be irrelevant for the fact that we might have the cost per usage now (it's basically the 2 variables we have divided) - **so can be redudant to have this data again** and the remaining can be incorporated in other variables already directly. Also, there are a lot of different values in this field which can create too much noise to our models.

# In[36]:


# let's confirm that the cost per unit is similar to what we have already as a ratio

df_lid = df6[['amortized_cost', 'usage_amount', 'line_item_description']].copy()

df_lid['description_price'] = df_lid.line_item_description.str.extract('([0-9][.]*[0-9]*)').astype('float')
df_lid['price_per_unit'] = np.round(np.where(df_lid['usage_amount'] == 0, 0, df_lid['amortized_cost']/df_lid['usage_amount']).astype('float'), 3)
df_lid.head(5)


# In[37]:


df_lid.describe().T


# In[38]:


lid_grouped = df6.groupby('line_item_description', dropna=False).agg({'amortized_cost':['count', 'sum']}).reset_index()
lid_grouped.columns = lid_grouped.columns.map('_'.join)
lid_grouped['pct_count'] = round(lid_grouped['amortized_cost_count'] * 100/sum(lid_grouped['amortized_cost_count']), 1)
lid_grouped['pct_cost'] = round(lid_grouped['amortized_cost_sum'] * 100/sum(lid_grouped['amortized_cost_sum']), 1)
lid_grouped = lid_grouped.sort_values('pct_count', ascending=False)
lid_grouped


# To conclude, we see that the price per unit seems to match the amount of amortized cost per usage amount (and what we have as usage_amount seem to match the amount of GBs consumed).  Also, the values are really spread out and with few meaning for all (there is no dominant distinct value).
# **Therefore, it looks like this variable might be irrelevant to our work.**

# #### *Usage Type*

# This variable is related with another AWS service detail. Its mode is "Data Volume" and let's see remaining cardinality distribution.

# In[39]:


plt.figure(figsize=(30,8))
splot = sns.countplot(x="usage_type",data=df6)
for p, item in zip(splot.patches, splot.get_xticklabels()):
  splot.annotate(format(p.get_height(), '.2f'), (p.get_x() + p.get_width() / 2., p.get_height()),  ha = 'center', va = 'center', xytext = (0, 5), textcoords = 'offset points')
  item.set_rotation(45)


# In[40]:


# relate with the cost variable
plt.figure(figsize=(30,8))
splot = sns.barplot(data=df6, x="usage_type", y="amortized_cost")
for p, item in zip(splot.patches, splot.get_xticklabels()):
  splot.annotate(format(p.get_height(), '.2f'), (p.get_x() + p.get_width() / 2., p.get_height()),  ha = 'center', va = 'center', xytext = (0, 10), textcoords = 'offset points')
  item.set_rotation(45)


# As we see, there is a **dominance** in terms of value distribution within its class in **"Data Volume" and "Operations"**. This doesn't translate into higher average costs of course, as we know that the majority of costs are close to 0.
# - We observe, as well, that we have some "Operations" values related between them (specifying the time span in parenthesis), but probably grouping all of them is a good idea. Same applies to the "Instance Hour" values.
# - We have some nulls in our dataset that by itself might not have the most impact but still, can be useful so we'll keep them.
# - We will aggregate the remaining values to "Other" as well as the nulls!

# In[41]:


df7 = df6.copy()
df7['usage_type'] = df7['usage_type'].fillna('Other')
df7['usage_type'] = np.where(df7['usage_type'].str.contains('Operations'), 'Operations', df7['usage_type'])

# #### *Usage Type AWS*

# This variable is related with the previous one but with a lot of cardinality, just like the "line_item_description".

top_values.columns = top_values.columns.map('_'.join)
top_values = top_values.sort_values('amortized_cost_count', ascending=False)
top_values.head(20)


# As seen with the top 20 values in terms of frequency, we have some options to deal with this column:
# - First, we can specify the type of usage, so for instance have values like "Requests - Tiers2, DataTransfer-Out-Bytes, DNS-Queries, etc etc";
# - OR, we can split and create a new column with the info of the name of the server where the data is being moved: "USW1, EUC1, etc etc".
# 
# 
# **The problem here is that there are many correlated values within each distribution (for instance we can have EUC1 server, but on other we have EUC1-USW2), which can indicate that both servers have interactions here.**
# 
# Even if we do treatments, it's difficult to get to a correct distribution or else we get a high cardinality still without any dominant value. **Thus, it's better to leave out this variable for now.**

# #### *Operation*

# **We can do similar treatments here as done in the past.** First, lets consider all strings before ":" or "-", because we have operations like "CreateDBInstance:0002" and "	CreateDBInstance:0014", for instance, which might not be so relevant to distinguish this detail. So, we'll group them all and, then, we'll consider a large cumulative percentage of distincts and then treat remaining categories as "Other".

# In[45]:

# **We managed to keep still a high cardinality (88 distinct values) but more manageable now!**

# #### *Environment Tag*

# This variable is now related with which portions of the client infrastructure are using the services and what's their work environment. Pretty straigthforward with 15 distinct string values but with a lot of nulls. Let's inspect:

# In[48]:


plt.figure(figsize=(15,8))
splot = sns.countplot(x="environment_tag",data=df8.fillna('Missing'))
for p in splot.patches:
  splot.annotate(format(p.get_height(), '.2f'), (p.get_x() + p.get_width() / 2., p.get_height()),  ha = 'center', va = 'center', xytext = (0, 5), textcoords = 'offset points')

# Some interesting results we have here:
# - First, the nulls dominate our distribution
# - We have a 'Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯' value which is comic and it can be relatable to the nulls as well (we don't know either), so let's group them and call it 'Unknown'
# - Like other cols, some values here can be aggregated so that we have less environment tags.

# In[50]:


df9 = df8.copy()

df9 = df9[df9['environment_tag'] != 'corporate']# remove "corporate" row as it is only 1 observation and it quite some cost, so can be seen as outlier (also, this might not be a valid environment tag)

# ### New features - One Hot Encoding

# Now, to turn our models more efficient or even possible (in case of a time series regression), we have to transform the categorical variables into int variables. To do this, we can do several ways, namely by:
# - Encoding our data and creating a multi flag inside each column, which lowers the dimensionality but it might "confuse" our models (in the sense that higher number cardinality doesn't mean anything in this case);
# - Target encoding, which actually could be very useful and it keeps the dimensionality low as well (it's like the previous method but it weights regarding the distribution of values in each class)
# - **One Hot Encoding**, which is basically creating multiple binary flags representing each class of each variable.
# This is a very popular method, so let's check its appeal.

# In[55]:


# But first, remove the 2 columns and groupby all the others so we have less volumetry
df11 = df10.copy()

df11 = df11.drop(columns = ['line_item_description', 'usage_type_aws'])

df11 = df11.groupby([c for c in df11.columns if c not in ['amortized_cost', 'usage_amount']], dropna=False)             .agg({'amortized_cost':'sum', 'usage_amount':'sum'}).reset_index()

summary(df11)


# **VoilÃ¡! The volumetry of the database drastically changed when we removed both columns and by changing the granularity to a higher level, we have much less rows (around 388k)**, which can improve our models' performance. However, this has a cost where we can loose information of each single point with both removed columns information.

# We have 136 columns in total now and although some dummies might be irrelelvant (in a sense that per field with X distinct values we only need X-1 dummies (if all are 0 then we match the last value). However, since we have fields with a lot of dimensions in them, it might be more useful to still add X variables per categoric field.

# ##Data Normalization

# This step is very important, as we need to rescale our data for modelling reasons (with exception of the date column). This means that standardizing and putting all of them in the same scale (namely usage_amount, amortized_cost and remaining dummy variables) is much needed to improve accuracy.
# 
# ---
# 
# 
# **The method we are going to choose is the normalization, doing a min max scaling between 0 and 1**.
# Other methods like Standard Scaler could be used but this method is more intuitive and easier to interpret and also less sensitive to outliers, which can be important in this case, as we still decided to kept some possible outliers in our data.

# ##Time Series Feature Engineering

# - For the next step, we'll expand further the variables we have but reduce drastically the volume of our DB, having into account that we want to model based on our daily data but with **multi lagged variables**.
# For this, we need to resample our data at a daily granularity doing the mean of all the features (so, it works like an aggregation step).
# 
# - Then, it will be useful to assess if an the best approach should be an **Auto Regressive model** (so using the target variable: amortized_cost as predictors/independent variables as well) or if it's better to not mix with it and keep it only as the target.
# 
# - Finally, we'll remove some features based on the importance of each variable before doing our forecasting model.

# As seen above, we can take a **completely different conclusion than before**. In fact, there seems to be a generalized upwards trend from 2021 onwards and this might be due to the fact that we were in COVID years until end of 2022 where life tended to become normal like before and, so, maybe costs and usage rose. Despite these spikes in may 2022 and October 2022 (these can be outliers), we see staber floatings and upwards trend from  6 to 6 months. This info may be very useful for our modelling and indicates very well what should be our lag number (so having a 6 months lag span). *There seems to be a very good correlation between the cost and the usage as well!*
# **To further compare, we'll do the same graphs for weekly data and for monthly data and decide later on the best time granularity to use.**

# Analysing monthly graph, we don't see much findings in terms of patterns like we saw with daily data. For weekly, we see more interesting conclusions with a better pattern but still a bit weird, specially in the final weeks of our dataset.
# 
# **Thus, we will keep on using daily data.**

# ###Correlation between Variables and Features Removal

# Let's assess for a Pearson's correlation test (using an heatmap) and check for redudant variables or other possible relationships between them.
# Since, we have lots of variables, we are only going to assess the **relationship between the continuous variables and product_tag**, since these are requirement for our independent variables.

# In[63]:


# since we have many variables, lets remove the variable "operation..." for this part only

figure = plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))

# As expected, the paradigm changes now. We see much more correlation when we resample the data and there are even variables pratically all correlated: this is the case for usage_amount and amortized_cost (proven in the graph above) as well as the product_tag_4 and product_tag_6, with almost 1 in Pearson correlation.
# *Almost all seem to have a positive mid to strong connection with the dependent variable, with exception of product_tag_product_1 which seems to be negatively correlated*.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# **Thus, we shall remove redundant variables with correlation higher than 0.9 to the target variable and those who have null values (means that its normalized values are always 0 or close) and we'll do this for the whole dataset (not just for these features).**

# In[64]:

# fill the ones all null so they are removed

# To conclude, we will remove a lot of variables now because most of them were extremely high correlated with the costs variable, making them redundant and could potentially hurt the model or at least don't provide useful information.
# **The usage_amount was one of those variables given its pretty strong positive correlation. Also, the product tag of product 7 was proven to be redundant too.**
# 
# 
# We'll keep 47 columns in total before getting to more features to be created (lag variables) and we proceed with further feature importance and removal, having into account Auto Regressive models (i.e. with the help of lagged values for the target variable to predict its self values).

# # Time Series Forecast Modelling

# Now, its time for the modelling part given the data and the treatments we already have.
# 
# For the purpose of being a MultiVariate Time Series Regression model, I decided to explore one simpler ML model and a DL model:
# - Light GBM model
# - LSTM model

# ##LightGBM Model

# LightGBM (LGBM) is a gradient boosting framework that is known for its efficiency, speed, and accuracy in handling large-scale datasets.
# It is capable of capturing complex nonlinear relationships between the independent and target variables. For feature importance is also really helpful and we can set a ranking like we'll see more ahead.
# 
# **A test using an autoregressive lagged model (i.e. using the own target lagged variable to predict the future values of itself) will be made and, finally, a non AR model will be assessed as well to remove any possible bias and try to include as most as possible the influence of "Product_tag" and other columns so we can reach conclusions.**

# Now there's more balance in terms of variable importance, not only in product, but also operations related. Different lags have influence as well and in mixed fashion.

# Next, let's experiment a Deep Learning model to complement or possibly change this analysis and assess which model performs best, so that conclusions can be taken on a best accurate cost forecast and which were the main drivers of this spend increase, so that the company can focus mostly on some specific usages.

# ## LSTM Model

# LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that has several advantages for data modelling, including time series forecasting. It is very good to capture long term dependencies and that is the case for our dataset where we have to predict 6 months ahead based on previous 1 and half years (in days). It also deals well with noisy data. The issue that can arise here is that we can add more complexity than what is needed for the model (as the LGBM already performed quite well).
# 
# **We'll experiment using only a non AutoRegressive model to compare with the latter LGBM.**

# As seen above, the model learned quite quickly its pattern and we don't gain much information/model improvement, when we iterate over more than **20 epochs**. The error seems relatively low already and slightly decreasing in the train and in the test as well, which is a good indicator.
# 
# However, they have quite some gap between them, which can mean that the model is slightly overfitted and, as we saw before, this is no surprise, as we still have highly correlated features and further PCA or feature reduction could have been done in order to avoid this.
# 
# Nevertheless, this model seems to be an improvement over the LGBM due to its MSE metric being lower for the test set (0.0221 vs 0.0492), even though we lose interpretability using this method.

# As we can see, **The Product 5 labeled in Product Tag** is the most important feature (without accounting for the own cost feature and with different time lags. Moreover, **Send and List Subsriptions Operations** and **different Product Codes** (like Amazon MSK or "Others"), also contributte fairly well for our time series model.

# **Note: Both of these models can be further exploited with hyperparameter fine tuning in order to have a better overall model and more adapted to this data. Further ML and DL models can be studeid and added as well.**

# #Unsupervised Learning - Clustering

# To answer to the second question of prioritization for optimization efforts (in terms of AWS service and/or infrastructure components), an unsupervised method was used, in order to group sets of data depending on the averages spend, in order to check for patterns in data.
# 
# For simplicity and good understandability, a **K-Means** algorithm was used in order to complement our data analysis and understand the main drivers of spend for the client.

# By the analysis of above graphs and the aggregate table, **we conclude that both clientâ€™s infrastructure components (product (tag) & environment (tag)) and the AWS service information** are key drivers for the increase in costs that's been happening.
# 
# On average, certain operations like "List Subscriptions", "create snapshots" and "VPN connections" are costly for the client. Other operations of course are included.
# 
# **In terms of infrustructure, we see products 4, 6 and 5 as the most relevant regrding the most costs increase and the UAT environment is often related with mosts costs as well. All of these are mostly related with the usage as well, because we know that the higher the usage in these products or services, the higher will be the costs. Thus, the client should focus on spending less resources in these fields and optimize both product and AWS service usage to control expenses.**

# # Conclusions

# **To sum up this exercise, we analysed and concluded that the client should:**
# 
# 
# *   Focus on both AWS service and infrastructure usage amounts, to control better its costs.
# *   Special focus on controlling Operations such as Listing Subscriptions, Creating Snapshots of data and providing VPN acesses
# 
# 
# *   Regarding the Product and environment side: Products 4,6,5 and UAT working env should be prioritized as these are usually associated with high costs per usage or high usages
# 
# 
# 
# *   In terms of forecasting costs, we discovered that the main drivers on the product side is clearly the Product 5 (with different time lags), but also other Product Codes and "Send" Operations are big drivers when we want to forecast future costs based on the past data we have available.
